    <Settings_Desc>The mood bonus and duration are determined by Relative Quality. Relative Quality is the difference between the item's quality rank and the pawn's crafting skill rank. This allows pawns with lower skills to also feel pride when crafting good items. The quality ranks are specified as follows:
        0: Awful / Skill Level 0
        1: Poor / Skill Level 1-4
        2: Normal / Skill Level 5-9
        3: Good / Skill Level 10-18
        4: Excellent / Skill Level 19+
        5: Masterwork
        6: Legendary
        For example: If a pawn with a crafting skill of 8 crafts a Chain Shotgun (Good), their Relative Quality is 3 - 2 = 1.</Settings_Desc>
