    <Settings_Desc>Relative Quality is the difference between the quality of the item and the pawn's crafting level rank, so that lower level pawns will also take pride in crafting normal items. The rank are specified as follows:
        0: Awful, craft 0;
        1: Poor, craft 1-4;
        2: Normal, craft 5-9;
        3: Good, craft 10-18;
        4: Excellent, craft 19+;
        5: Masterwork;
        6: Legendary;
        If a crafted 8 pawn makes a Chain Shotgun (Good), the Relative Quality is 3 - 2 = 1.</Settings_Desc>
